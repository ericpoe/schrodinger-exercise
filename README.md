# schrodinger #
An OOP thought-exercise to model Schr√∂dinger's Cat.

## Background ##
The gist of the original thought-exercise is that a living cat is placed inside of a weaponized black box. The weapon is triggered by a the decay of a radioactive atom as measured by a Geiger counter. From outside of the box, we have no way of knowing whether or not the atom has decayed, so we have no way of knowing whether or not the cat is still alive. At this point, the cat is considered to be both alive and not alive.
